As the true reasons for his injuries begin to surface, Max and George continue to argue particularly after Wetherby tells Max that George has been violent towards his son. Determined to take Jimmy back to Rhodesia with him, Max becomes unhinged and violent. Taking Jimmy away from his mother at gunpoint, he threatens anyone that comes near, including Bellamy, Mason, Wetherby and George. Concerned for the boy\\u2019s wellbeing, and stepping into the line of fire Bellamy tries to talk Max around and take control of the situation. Unable to calm the menacing father, Bellamy\\u2019s life flashes before him as Max pulls the trigger on the gun. Bellamy falls to the floor, and dies in Joe\\u2019s arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPictured:  Max Philpott (Daniel Ryan), PC Don Wetherby (Rupert Ward-Lewis)  Jimmy Masters (Dominic Holmes), Mary Masters (Naomi Radcliffe), Pc Phil Bellamy (Mark Jordon) and  PC Joe Mason (Mark Jordon)\\n\\nPhotographer Helen Turton\\n\\nfor further Picture information please contact:\\nTracey Whitton: 0113 222 7115\\n\\n\\nThis photograph is (C) ITV Plc and can only be reproduced for editorial purposes directly in connection with the programme or event mentioned above, or ITV.
