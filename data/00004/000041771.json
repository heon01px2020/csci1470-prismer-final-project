While habitat loss is still considered the most serious threat to the majority of species, especially in the humid tropical forest regions of the world, a fungal disease known as chytrid has been identified as being exceptionally deadly to amphibians, while not seeming to affect other groups of vertebrates - fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. A frog-killing fungus in Central and South America spreads in waves like other infectious diseases, challenging a theory that climate change is to blame.
